# Pomodoro APP

Get your working time flow right with it

To develop just open the folder as an Android project on Android Studio 
(If not you will need to set your Android SDK as a system variable or at a local.properties file)

To build production release apk:
```./gradlew assembleProductionRelease```

To build development debug apk:
```./gradlew assembleDevelopmentDebug```

To generate bundle for App Store
```./gradlew bundleProductionRelease```

Outputs will be located at
```path/app/build/outputs/apk or path/app/build/outputs/bundle```



cheers!
